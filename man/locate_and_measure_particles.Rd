\arguments{
\item{to.data}{path to the working directory}

\item{raw.avi.folder}{directory with the raw avi files (converted and compressed from the raw videos)}

\item{particle.data.folder}{directory to which the data is saved as a text file}

\item{difference.lag}{numeric value specifying the offset between two video frames to 
compute the difference image. If 0, then no differencing applied.}

\item{min_size}{minimum size for detection of particles}

\item{max_size}{maximum size for detection of particles}

\item{thresholds}{vector containing the min and max threshold values (defaults to c(10,255))}

\item{tools.path}{path to the directory where the tools for bemovi (fiji, ffmpeg and bftools) are stored}

\item{memory}{numeric value specifying the amount of memory available to ImageJ (defaults to 512)}

\item{memory.per.identifier}{numeric value specifying the amount of memory to reserve for every imageJ instance (defaults to 10000)}

\item{max.cores}{numeric value, specifying the maximum number of cores to use for particle identification (defaults to # of machine cores - 1)}
}
\value{
saves the output of the ParticleAnalyzer function of ImageJ as a text file in the output directory and then assembles the data into a single database 
called 'particle.RData'. This data.frame contains information about the following properties: the area (transversal cut), 
the mean, minimum and maximum of the grey value, the perimeter, width, length and angle with the dominant-axis of a fitted ellipse, and finally shape parameters such as
circularity, aspect ratio, roundness and solidity. For details of the morphological output, please refer to http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/docs/guide/146-30.html
}
\description{
Function calls ImageJ software and its ParticleAnalyzer function to extract for each frame of the video
several morphological descriptors and the X- and Y-coordinates of all moving particles. All videos in the raw.avi.folder are analyses, separately.
